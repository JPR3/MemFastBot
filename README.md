# MemFastBot
This program was created to automatically play the game [Memorize Fast](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-memorize-fast) on Coolmath Games.
The game is a simple timed memory game that progressively gets more and more challenging as it goes on. While results may vary on different devices to to differences in processing speed, on my computer it was able to play indefinetly.
#### Note: This hasn't been tested on any computer/resolution other than my own. Results may vary!

## Usage
To use the program, ensure you first have the game pulled up and ready to play in your browser. Start the program, and then click and drag from the top left of the game window to the bottom right to define the area for the computer to search. The smaller you are able to make this, the faster it will find the images. After you've done this, simply start the game and watch the bot get to work!

To stop the program, simply move the mouse to any corner of your screen.

## Future plans
The next step for this program would be to make it easier for users to define the selection area, or perhaps have the program to that automaically. Also, improvements to the speed at which it finds all the pairs would help it be more powerful on slower computers.
